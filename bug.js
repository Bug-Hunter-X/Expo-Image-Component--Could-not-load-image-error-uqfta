This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that isn't properly formatted or accessible.  It might point to a local file that doesn't exist, a remote URL that's incorrect or unreachable, or a URI that the `Image` component doesn't support.  Here's an example:

```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'invalid-image-uri' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```

This would throw the `Error: Could not load image: invalid-image-uri` if that URI is invalid.
